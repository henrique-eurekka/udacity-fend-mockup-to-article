You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  

* What new skills have you learned?
  

I've learned to: 
- pay attentions to details such as always closing a tag.
- use indenting to make my code easier to read and more organized.
- open and use the dev tools in both browsers
- pay attention to tags that might do the same thing, such as <b> and <strong>, but have specific usages.

* What has been easy?
  

- editing the text, as I've had some practice with it while doing other Udacity courses.
- quick testing changes made in the editor via browser (which is way faster than, for example, running an android app via Android Studio).

* What has been difficult?


- this course's been altogether very simple.

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

- I did a good amount of google searches to find for the exact tag to a certain goal.
